            <p class="image-description">you really should not leave the kathmandu city
                 without trying momos: dumplings, served steamed or fried with a variety of fillings. 
                 Locals and foreign visitors alike swear by this small family-run place in the heart of Thamel,
                saying it serves the best momos in town. It is popular enough you will need to arrive early to 
                ensire a table (reservations are not possible). The fried chili momos are much-praised here, 
                along with the chicken version. For much of the evening the kitchen is a continuous momo 
                production lineâ€”and it needs to be to cope with demand. Some Western dishes are also offered,
                 but they pale in comparison to the main attraction.
